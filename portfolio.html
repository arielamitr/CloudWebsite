      <h1>Technical Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my technical portfolio! On this page, you'll be able to explore some of the projects that I've worked on and learn a bit more about them. Links to the relevant materials will be posted as they become available/completed.</p>

      <h1>Meta University: Accord</h1>

      <p>Over the summer, I was lucky enough to be granted the opportunity to work for Meta (previously Facebook) as part of their Meta University program. I was placed on the Android App development team, and was given creative freedom over what type of Android application I wanted to build. This led to the creation of Accord: a matching app for musicians to find bandmates by instrument, music taste, and location. The app implemented a custom matching algorithm to sort potential users by likelihood of a match, as well as an ELO system that ranked users based on how frequently their profile was positively interacted with.</p>
      <p>The entire app was developed over the course of eight weeks using Android App Studio with the use of Java. Throughout the project, I got experience creating and managing a database, as well as making API calls to load the information from that database into the user interface. The user interface for this project was the most time-consuming aspect, although it wasn't a required part of the project. As a developer, I am extremely interested in usability of programs, not just the functionality itself. Because of this, I went above and beyond the expectation laid out by the program for basic functionality to include interactive UI elements such as changing profile photos, the ability to upload and autoplay videos as part of a profile, and the implementation of an external messaging UI.</p>
      <p>Aside from the technical elements of this project, the internship taught me a lot about the professional interactions I could expect within a workplace. I had a manager that I met with frequently, and over the course of the internship, we forged a strong professional relationship. I also spent a large portion of my summer helping other interns with their projects, as I tended to be ahead of schedule and thus able to provide them with valuable insight when they reached roadblocks in their project design.

      <h1 id = "researchHeading">Undergraduate Research: The Ethics of AI Art</h1>
      <p id = "researchText">I am currently starting a research project at Texas A&M under <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/guofei.html">Guofei Gu</a>. It is a user-focused study in the field of cybersecurity, and as of now, we are only in the beginning stages of this research project. In this project, we hope to better understand how the general public feels about the rise in AI-generated images, especially as it pertains to artists whose work is used to train AI without compensation. Specifically, we are interested in a study of how these opinions vary across age groups, and if there is a correlation between AI ethics and technology use. This will be a user-focused study conducted within the cybersecurity field, with the intent of setting up future research to look into solutions to this problem if it turns out to be one. We are in the development stage of this project right now, which includes designing the study and getting it approved by a committee on user-focused studies. Updates will be posted to this site as the research project develops.</p>
