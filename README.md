# CSCE_315_mitrani

Repo for project 1 of 315, Spring 2023

GITHUB COMMITS ARE NOT AS FREQUENT AS MAY BE EXPECTED.
Since most of the work I did on this was done on-campus, I was directly editing the files in virtual space.
Thus, in order to commit to git, I had to copy the files to my local computer unnecessarily.
Many students worked on their local machine and then uploaded the files to host, I did the opposite.
Additionally, most of the work I did on this project was in large chunks, so I would do all the css at the same time, and thus only had one commit at the end of a coding session.

Please keep these things in mind when analyzing the frequency of git commits! Since I didn't work on this much away from campus, there was no reason for me to host the files locally.

T's & G's!
