    <h1>Giving Back is Important...</h1>
    <p>Which is why I make an effort to give back to my community as much as I can. Apart from the organizations I've included below, I was also a youth group calendar, and frequently tutor peers in a variety of engineering disciplines. Below, I've highlighted the two service organizations that I dedicate the most significant portion of my time to.</p>

    <h1 id="tansa">Texas A&M National Scholars Ambassadors</h1>
     <img src="tansaHeadshot.webp" alt="TANSA Headshot">
    <p><a href="https://www.aggietansa.com//">TANSA</a> is an on-campus organization focused on recruitment of national scholars to attend Texas A&M. When I was a prospective student, I got to have lunch with a panel of TANSA members, which heavily influenced my decision to attend A&M. I absolutely love my school, and cannot imagine myself being anywhere else. Because of that, I joined TANSA: I want to be able to share my passion for A&M with prospective students, in order to help them get to what I believe is the best college education in America. As an out-of-state student, I was nervous coming into A&M, which is a majority in-state school. However, I cannot imagine myself anywhere else, and love sharing that passion with others.</p>
    <h1>Chabad On-Campus</h1>
    <p>Another organization that I spend a lot of time at is the <a href="https://www.jewishaggies.com/">Chabad at Texas A&M</a>. Through Chabad, I have not only been able to connect more strongly with my Jewish identity, but also find a second family away from home. My freshman year, I largely was just a participant. However, now as a sophomore, I have started working at Chabad in order to help cook for ~80 other Jewish Aggies weekly. Although I am not very religious, Chabad has been an incredibly welcoming and inclusive community. From bringing students soup when they get sick to events with Kosher food at least three days a week, it has been a truly positive place in every aspect. If you are curious to see some of the events they host, check out the <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/chabadtamu/"> TAMU Chabad Instagram</a>!</p>
