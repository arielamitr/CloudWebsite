  <p>My name is Ariela Mitrani, and I am a sophomore Computer Science major at <a 
  href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. If you want to learn more about who I am, this is the site for you! Use the above navigation bar to go page to page and learn about some of the projects I've worked on, organizations I've participated in, and to view my portfolio. </p>

  <p>I am an outgoing, bubbly student studying Computer Science, with minors in Mathematics and Cybersecurity. I'm currently involved in undergraduate research regarding the ethics of artificial intelligence creating art, and taking a challenging courseload including classes about computer systems and algorithm analysis. I am also currently a member of the Texas A&M National Scholars Ambassadors, and love to tell prospective students about my experiences at A&M. Outside of my academic pursuits, I really enjoy creative projects, especially music. I am a singer in two punk/rock bands, and also songwrite frequently.</p>

  <p>I am a very social person, and I love to work in teams. Company culture is very important to me, and I think that my ability to contribute positively to a work environment is one of my greatest strengths.
