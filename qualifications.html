    <p id = "interestText">I am very interested in specifically the cybersecurity aspect of computer science. We must pursue a concentration area outside of the computer science discipline as part of our undergraduate degree program at A&M, and I've chosen to do a cybersecurity concentration area. I will be graduating with minors both in <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/cybersecurity-minor/#programrequirementstext">interdisciplinary cybersecurity</a> and <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/arts-and-sciences/mathematics/minor/#programrequirementstext">mathematics</a>, as the intersection of cybersecurity and mathematics is extremely important and less explored by CS students. Currently, I am doing research on the user-facing aspect of Artificial Intelligence, and hope to be on the forefront of AI development when I graduate from college. I am much more interested in frontend than backend coding, but given that I still have relatively little experience as I am a sophomore in college, I am open to trying anything because I don't have any particular areas of disinterest. My interest in cybersecurity stems from the fact that I think we are getting into new territory with the internet too quickly to keep up with the security aspects, and thus I feel the field will be a continously pressing one. By concentrating my education in cybersecurity, I am making sure that I have the skills necessary to always be on the forefront of combatting these issues. Additionally, as a hispanic woman, I know that people in the hispanic community are disproportionately affected by cybersecurity threats, something that has been <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/resources/2021-demographics-of-cybercrime-report/index.html#bipoc">repeatedly shown in demographic data</a>. Because of this, I hope to be able to make a difference and help bridge the cybersecurity risk gap, decreasing it for the communities most impacted. This, combined with my strong interest in mathematics, made cybersecurity the field of computer science I was most drawn to. I am also an extremely social person, which has heavily influenced my interest in frontend coding. My strengths lie in making technology accessible and aesthetically pleasing, hence my interest in frontend.</p>
